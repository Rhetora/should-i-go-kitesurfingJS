# Should I go kitesurfing?
A personal project to produce an interactive web application that takes weather forecast data, determines whether the conditions are suitable for kitesurfing, and displays the data and insights in a clear interface.

The secondary goal is to build this app in vanilla Javascript, developing skills in:

- Javascipt
- HTML
- CSS
- REST APIs
- User Interfaces
